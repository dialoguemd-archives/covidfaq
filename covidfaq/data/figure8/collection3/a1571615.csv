 •  Direct: phone calls, video chats, text messages, social networks, digital apps (WhatsApp, Skype, etc.) or other technologies.
•  Indirect: prerecorded voice messages or videos, letters, postcards, digital photos.
•  Creative: drawings, crafts, photo collages, a recording of yourself reading a children’s story, arrange a time to say hello from your balcony or the street, dinner for two by Skype.

•  Follow the usual hygiene measures for contact with animals. To find out more, go to the page  http://www.mapaq.gouv.qc.ca/zoonoses  (Diseases that can be spread from animals to humans – in French only).
•  Ideally, keep pets in a room or a cage that is reserved for their use in order to limit contact and contamination of the environment.
•  For pets that go outside, always use a leash or a fenced area.
If someone else has to look after your pet, choose a member of your household if possible. Tell them about the hygiene measures to follow, in particular limit contact with the pet, wash their hands before and after looking after the pet and disinfect any items the sick person touched and that the pet might have had contact with, such as toys, the leash or the poop bag holder.
 These measures must be followed for 14 days after symptoms appear.

•  parents’ medium and long-term income is hard to establish for the time being;
•  according to the rules governing support, the parents’ foreseeable income for the next 12 months as well as their assets can be taken into consideration.

 The https://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/en/couples-and-families/separation-and-divorce/children-a-joint-responsibility/child-support/csptool/ is available to help you estimate child support payments you must make or will receive based on your individual situation. The interactive form costs nothing to use, and is simple and quick to complete. Simply enter your data, and the calculation will be carried out automatically.
 Before adjusting the amount of child support payable, if you’ve lost your job, for instance, it would be best to know the amounts to which you will be entitled in order to determine your income.
 The child support payment amount can also include costs related to children, for example daycare costs. Since parents will not have to cover these costs during the pandemic whether or not they are entitled to emergency daycare services, they may be taken into account when reviewing the support payable, but only for the period during which these fees are waived.
 Educational childcare services will be free for parents who are essential service workers, which entitles them to emergency daycare services. Parents’ contributions will be covered by the Ministère de la Famille. Parents who can no longer use educational childcare services during the public health emergency will no longer have to pay childcare costs.

 Food establishment operators (restaurants, supermarkets, slaughterhouses, butchers, dairy plants, processing plants, etc.) play an important role in preventing foodborne illnesses. In the current context, they should follow public health recommendations and the following guidelines:
 •  Ensure that staff under their responsibility are aware of issues related to COVID19;
•  Rest assured that the staff respect the rigorous sanitary guidelines recommended by the public health authorities;
•  Ensure that food handlers are properly trained in food hygiene practices;
•  Ensure effective supervision of food handlers to enhance hygiene practices in the establishment;
•  Ensure that the appropriate facilities are available for hand washing;
•  Ensure that food handlers are aware that they must report any symptoms of respiratory illness before or during work;
•  Ensure that food handlers and other personnel are not ill;
•  Ensure that staff with symptoms remain at home until medical advice is received;
•  Enhance cleaning and sanitation procedures for items that are exposed to public handling (handles, crates, counters, menus, etc.). Special attention should be paid to fast food or self-service locations where utensils can be handled by several people;
•  The use of self-service buffets where people have to wait in line, close to each other and close to food and utensils, is an increased risk and should be avoided;
•  Provide for additional or alternative refrigerated or frozen storage capacities to meet the food demand, which is likely subject to change (decreased demand in the hotel, restaurant and institutional sectors, increased demand for food products at retail locations);
•  Prepare an action plan in the event of a labour shortage. Do not neglect cleaning and sanitation activities and processing methods that require qualifications. If necessary, prioritize activities that ensure the best means of food availability and abandon other activities.

 Currently, 70% alcohol and sodium hypochlorite are known to be particularly effective against coronavirus.
 Confirm with your suppliers how effective their cleaning and sanitizing procedures and products are against coronavirus. In case of doubt, it is best to keep the procedures already in place and always ensure that they are correctly applied, in accordance with manufacturer instructions.
 For non-food surfaces that are particularly exposed to the public (handles, crates, counters, etc.), more frequent cleaning using a disinfection method known to be effective against coronavirus is recommended. Health Canada has published a list of disinfectant products that can be used to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces.

 A 0.1% hypochlorite solution is sufficient to eliminate viruses such as coronavirus, which is less resistant than other pathogenic microorganisms.
 This is in line with current scientific literature on coronavirus and complies with recommendations from the CDC ( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fprevention.html ).

Remember that it is mandatory for every traveller returning to Canada to self-isolate for 14 days. No outings are permitted, except to obtain medical care.

Since it may use this power as many times as it deems appropriate, such an amendment could also apply during the period determined by the municipality. However, if a municipality's interest rate has been previously decreed by by-law, it would be preferable to use a regulatory procedure again to change the rate. In such a case, if there are doubts about the choice of procedure, the municipality should consult its legal counsel.

Thus, both the Cities and Towns Act and the Municipal Code provide that a deficit may be absorbed by the accumulated surpluses of the municipality or, in the absence of a surplus, consolidated by a borrowing by-law for a period of several years.
 Of course, considering the principle that the municipality must ensure that sufficient credits are available before authorizing an expenditure, the recourse to a deficit must be based on exceptional circumstances.

 For the time being, it would be premature to allow the electronic transmission of bids for the municipal sector.

However, certain rules must be applied to ensure the public nature and transparency of the contracting process.
 First, bids must be opened before two impartial witnesses. It is up to the municipal body to ensure that these witnesses have no connection with the contract in question.

Second, in order to ensure that the process is carried out in a transparent manner, the municipal body must post an audiovisual recording of the opening of bids in the form of an addendum in the electronic tendering system (SEAO). This will be transmitted by the SEAO to all purchasers of tender documents. Within 30 days of its publication by addendum, a citizen will be able to view the audiovisual recording associated with a call for tenders, provided that he or she has first registered with the SEAO.

Like any other Québec employer, municipalities are encouraged to give preference to strategies that allow as many employees as possible to be retained, while taking the necessary measures to protect their health and safety.
 A municipality could, among other things, give preference to
 •  telework.
•  redeployment to other essential services functions.
•  secondment to other municipal agencies, community organizations, or the health network.
It is important to remember that collective agreements in the municipal sector remain applicable in the context of a health emergency. The flexibilities required to take the situation into account must therefore be discussed with the associations and unions.
 Despite the obligation to adopt a balanced budget, a municipality cannot base a decision to lay off employees on the illegality of running a deficit during the year. Indeed, the law expressly provides for mechanisms to enable municipalities to run deficits.

The decision to proceed with layoffs is therefore a matter of municipal policy considerations rather than the application of legal provisions.

Because citizens are being asked to isolate, what is going to happen to non-priority projects in their municipality?","No public meetings required by a legislative or regulatory provision applicable to a municipality or metropolitan community may be held. This is the case, in particular, for meetings scheduled for purposes of development and urban planning.

In fact, under order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, any procedure involving the movement or gathering of citizens that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body is suspended or replaced.

It is the council that determines whether the public meeting is suspended or replaced.

 Suspension - If its council chooses to suspend the public meeting, the municipality should announce this decision by a public notice of postponement that indicates that a new public notice announcing the meeting will be issued once the health emergency is over. In this case, the regulatory adoption process is suspended until further notice. In due course, the ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation will contact municipalities to advise them that regular regulatory adoption processes are being reinstated.

 Replacement - If a council wishes to continue the process of passing the act that is the subject of the public meeting, it must designate it as a priority by a two-thirds majority vote. The consultation meeting is then replaced by a written consultation announced 15 days in advance by public notice. This has the effect of cancelling the meeting.

The Ministère recommends that this public notice
 •  describe the project that was to be the subject of a meeting but is instead the subject of a call for written comments.
•  specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is made available online.
•  indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15   days following publication of the notice.
Given the isolation of citizens, the government is asking municipalities to postpone (suspend) non-priority projects. Consultation by call for comments must be reserved for projects deemed to be priorities. Priority is given to a project that, for example, fosters public health or safety, contributes to environmental protection, represents a major economic opportunity for the community, has significant public support, etc.

During a health emergency, a project initially suspended by a municipality could be revived at a later date if public notice was given to announce that the public meeting is being replaced by the written consultation described above.

Finally, in addition to the usually mandatory consultation meetings, municipalities must not hold optional consultations (e.g., a public hearing by a municipality's demolition committee). The government is asking municipalities to consult citizens in other ways (survey or online consultation), or to postpone processes involving optional consultations.

In fact, pursuant to order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, any procedure involving the displacement or gathering of citizens that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body must be suspended or replaced. The indications previously provided for public meetings are applicable.

In the event of a health emergency and people cannot be heard in person, can citizens still be heard by the council?","The Act respecting land use planning and development provides that ""any interested person may be heard by the council"" when the council must decide on a request for a minor exemption or conditional use. However, council meetings may be held in camera during a health emergency.

In addition, pursuant to order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, any procedure involving the movement or gathering of citizens that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body must be suspended or replaced. The indications previously provided for public meetings are applicable.

Consequently, the municipality has two options:
 •  Municipalities may defer the authorization of a minor exemption or conditional use application to a subsequent meeting when the health emergency is lifted. The Act does not prescribe a time limit between the submission of a minor exemption or conditional use application and the adoption by council of the resolution granting the exemption or authorizing the use.
•  They may also replace the possibility of being heard by a written consultation, announced by a 15-day prior public notice.
Given the isolation in which citizens find themselves, the government is asking municipalities to reserve this written comment process for projects deemed a priority by a two-thirds majority vote. Non-priority projects should be deferred.

Nevertheless, citizens could submit requests to the municipality to open a register.

Here are some additional indications, depending on the situation.

 Planning and development - For draft by-laws under the Act respecting land use planning and development, the municipality may not proceed with the registration of qualified voters and the referendum process during a health emergency. However, qualified voters may submit applications for referendums.

These applications may be forwarded to the municipality individually, rather than by petition, to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The public notice announcing that provisions are subject to referendum approval could invite qualified voters to transmit their requests in this way.

If it receives a sufficient number of requests, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of council members, whether the project is a priority.
 •  For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation identical to the one planned as an alternative to public consultation meetings. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. If it has already held such a written consultation to replace the meeting provided for in the Act, it does not have to repeat it and the regulatory adoption process continues. If such a consultation has not previously taken place, the procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation recommends that this public notice •    describe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.  
•    specify the web address at which the proposed regulation or resolution is posted.  
•    indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15       days following publication of the notice.  

•  For non-priority projects, the municipality suspends the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted.
If the municipality does not receive a sufficient number of referendum applications, the regulatory adoption process continues (e.g., establishment of compliance by the regional county municipality).

Any use or activity aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19 or similar measures (e.g., temporary hospitals, screening centres) are exempt from the process of amending urban planning by-laws. During a health emergency, the Minister of Health and Social Services has the power to order the construction of any work or the installation of facilities for health purposes or the provision of health and social services. To do so, the minister is not required to comply with the regulations in force.

 Borrowing regulations, credit commitments, and creation of financial reserves For these projects, the municipality cannot undertake a registration process for qualified voters and referendum voting during a health emergency. As is normally the case, qualified voters cannot apply for these types of projects.

However, in order to determine the applicable procedure, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of the members of council, whether the project is a priority.
 •  For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. The procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation recommends that this public notice •    describe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.  
•    specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is posted.  
•    indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice.   


•  For projects deemed to be non-priority, the municipality will suspend the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted.
For all borrowing by-laws, regardless of the applicable procedure (priority project or project exempted from the referendum approval process), the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing must approve them, as is normally the case.

 Municipal territorial organization – The Act respecting  municipal territorial organization provides for the possibility of referendum approval processes in certain situations (municipal groupings, name change, change of regime, territorial annexation, attachment to a regional county municipality, etc.).

However, this process occurs only if the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing so orders, on the date stipulated by the latter. During a health emergency, if such a referendum process were to be ordered, it would not be held until the health emergency is lifted. The process would therefore be suspended until further notice.

Where public notice of the registration process has been given, but the registration process has not begun, the notice is cancelled. The same applies if a registration process has been initiated but has not been completed. As such, the registration process is considered not to have taken place. The municipality then determines whether or not the project is a priority.

The same applies when a register has been opened and a sufficient number of qualified voters have signed it. In this case, however, the ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation invites municipalities to postpone the referendum vote until the health emergency is lifted.

When a public meeting, a procedure for registering qualified voters, an advance poll, or a referendum poll is suspended pursuant to order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, the days included in the period of the health emergency are not taken into account for the purpose of determining the duration of the effect of the interim control.

If, at the end of the public health emergency, there are fewer than 60 days remaining in the effect of the interim control, the effect of the interim control shall be extended to 60 days.

For example, if there were 15 days remaining in the effect of the interim control when the health emergency was declared on March 13, 2020, the effect of the interim control would continue throughout the health emergency.

However, under order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, any procedure involving the movement or gathering of citizens that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body is suspended or replaced.

However, with respect to the process of division into electoral districts, the council is not required to exercise this choice at the stage of the adoption of the draft by-law or at the stage of the adoption of the by-law. In fact, in the event that the required number of notices of objection is not reached, the process can continue in accordance with the requirements of the AERM, which should allow the deadline for the adoption of the by-law to be met, specifically before June 1, 2020.

However, if the required number of notices of objection is reached, either at the draft by-law stage (s. 18) or at the by-law stage (s. 25), the municipality must decide whether to postpone the process of territorial division into electoral districts (suspension) or to replace the meeting provided for in the AERM with a written consultation (replacement).
