# Data Collection

## Figure Eight

This folder, `figure8`, contains results from data annotated on the figure-eight platform (also known as appen): https://appen.com/.

Each `collection` folder will contain aggregated results from the training in files that are named with the following convention:

`a*.csv` - Aggregated: This report aggregates all of the responses for each individual row in the job.

`f*.csv` - Full: This report lists each individual response from contributors as a separate row, along with other pertinent information such as IP address, Contributor ID, Trust Score and Channel.
