 Food establishment operators (restaurants, supermarkets, slaughterhouses, butchers, dairy plants, processing plants, etc.) play an important role in preventing foodborne illnesses. In the current context, they should follow public health recommendations and the following guidelines:
 •  Ensure that staff under their responsibility are aware of issues related to COVID19;
•  Rest assured that the staff respect the rigorous sanitary guidelines recommended by the public health authorities;
•  Ensure that food handlers are properly trained in food hygiene practices;
•  Ensure effective supervision of food handlers to enhance hygiene practices in the establishment;
•  Ensure that the appropriate facilities are available for hand washing;
•  Ensure that food handlers are aware that they must report any symptoms of respiratory illness before or during work;
•  Ensure that food handlers and other personnel are not ill;
•  Ensure that staff with symptoms remain at home until medical advice is received;
•  Enhance cleaning and sanitation procedures for items that are exposed to public handling (handles, crates, counters, menus, etc.). Special attention should be paid to fast food or self-service locations where utensils can be handled by several people;
•  The use of self-service buffets where people have to wait in line, close to each other and close to food and utensils, is an increased risk and should be avoided;
•  Provide for additional or alternative refrigerated or frozen storage capacities to meet the food demand, which is likely subject to change (decreased demand in the hotel, restaurant and institutional sectors, increased demand for food products at retail locations);
•  Prepare an action plan in the event of a labour shortage. Do not neglect cleaning and sanitation activities and processing methods that require qualifications. If necessary, prioritize activities that ensure the best means of food availability and abandon other activities.

It is therefore unlikely that such a transmission will take place. Adherence to good food hygiene and safety practices and safe cooking generally minimizes the risk of transmission of any foodborne contamination and illness.
 Food establishment operators (restaurants, supermarkets, slaughterhouses, butchers, dairy plants, processing plants, etc.) play an important role in preventing foodborne illnesses. In the current context, they should follow public health recommendations and the following guidelines:
 •  Ensure that staff under their responsibility are aware of issues related to COVID19;
•  Rest assured that the staff respect the rigorous sanitary guidelines recommended by the public health authorities;
•  Ensure that food handlers are properly trained in food hygiene practices;
•  Ensure effective supervision of food handlers to enhance hygiene practices in the establishment;
•  Ensure that the appropriate facilities are available for hand washing;
•  Ensure that food handlers are aware that they must report any symptoms of respiratory illness before or during work;

That means 4 teaspoons (20 ml) of domestic bleach in 1 litre of water. It is best to prepare a new diluted solution every day and not to mix bleach with any other cleaning products.
 A 0.1% hypochlorite solution is sufficient to eliminate viruses such as coronavirus, which is less resistant than other pathogenic microorganisms.
 This is in line with current scientific literature on coronavirus and complies with recommendations from the CDC ( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fprevention.html ).
 In the current context and according to the available scientific data, the proportions usually recommended (1:200) must be increased to 1:50 (equivalent to a 0.1% solution of sodium hypochlorite) as a precautionary measure.

Second, in order to ensure that the process is carried out in a transparent manner, the municipal body must post an audiovisual recording of the opening of bids in the form of an addendum in the electronic tendering system (SEAO). This will be transmitted by the SEAO to all purchasers of tender documents. Within 30 days of its publication by addendum, a citizen will be able to view the audiovisual recording associated with a call for tenders, provided that he or she has first registered with the SEAO. After this period, the audiovisual recording will no longer be available.
 Finally, if a municipal organization encounters a problem transferring its audiovisual recording to the SEAO, it can call upon the technical support of the SEAO's customer service department at the following address: https://seao.ca/Information/ServiceClientele.aspx ","In the context of the measures put in place by the government, how can municipalities ensure that the public nature of tender openings is protected and that the contracting process remains transparent?",

Like any other Québec employer, municipalities are encouraged to give preference to strategies that allow as many employees as possible to be retained, while taking the necessary measures to protect their health and safety.
 A municipality could, among other things, give preference to
 •  telework.
•  redeployment to other essential services functions.
•  secondment to other municipal agencies, community organizations, or the health network.
It is important to remember that collective agreements in the municipal sector remain applicable in the context of a health emergency. The flexibilities required to take the situation into account must therefore be discussed with the associations and unions.
 Despite the obligation to adopt a balanced budget, a municipality cannot base a decision to lay off employees on the illegality of running a deficit during the year. Indeed, the law expressly provides for mechanisms to enable municipalities to run deficits.

The decision to proceed with layoffs is therefore a matter of municipal policy considerations rather than the application of legal provisions.

In fact, under order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, any procedure involving the movement or gathering of citizens that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body is suspended or replaced.

It is the council that determines whether the public meeting is suspended or replaced.

 Suspension - If its council chooses to suspend the public meeting, the municipality should announce this decision by a public notice of postponement that indicates that a new public notice announcing the meeting will be issued once the health emergency is over. In this case, the regulatory adoption process is suspended until further notice. In due course, the ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation will contact municipalities to advise them that regular regulatory adoption processes are being reinstated.

 Replacement - If a council wishes to continue the process of passing the act that is the subject of the public meeting, it must designate it as a priority by a two-thirds majority vote. The consultation meeting is then replaced by a written consultation announced 15 days in advance by public notice. This has the effect of cancelling the meeting.

The Ministère recommends that this public notice
 •  describe the project that was to be the subject of a meeting but is instead the subject of a call for written comments.
•  specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is made available online.
•  indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15   days following publication of the notice.
Given the isolation of citizens, the government is asking municipalities to postpone (suspend) non-priority projects. Consultation by call for comments must be reserved for projects deemed to be priorities. Priority is given to a project that, for example, fosters public health or safety, contributes to environmental protection, represents a major economic opportunity for the community, has significant public support, etc.

During a health emergency, a project initially suspended by a municipality could be revived at a later date if public notice was given to announce that the public meeting is being replaced by the written consultation described above.

Finally, in addition to the usually mandatory consultation meetings, municipalities must not hold optional consultations (e.g., a public hearing by a municipality's demolition committee).

 •  Municipalities may defer the authorization of a minor exemption or conditional use application to a subsequent meeting when the health emergency is lifted. The Act does not prescribe a time limit between the submission of a minor exemption or conditional use application and the adoption by council of the resolution granting the exemption or authorizing the use.
•  They may also replace the possibility of being heard by a written consultation, announced by a 15-day prior public notice.
Given the isolation in which citizens find themselves, the government is asking municipalities to reserve this written comment process for projects deemed a priority by a two-thirds majority vote. Non-priority projects should be deferred.

 Planning and development - For draft by-laws under the Act respecting land use planning and development, the municipality may not proceed with the registration of qualified voters and the referendum process during a health emergency. However, qualified voters may submit applications for referendums.

These applications may be forwarded to the municipality individually, rather than by petition, to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The public notice announcing that provisions are subject to referendum approval could invite qualified voters to transmit their requests in this way.

If it receives a sufficient number of requests, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of council members, whether the project is a priority.
 •  For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation identical to the one planned as an alternative to public consultation meetings. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. If it has already held such a written consultation to replace the meeting provided for in the Act, it does not have to repeat it and the regulatory adoption process continues. If such a consultation has not previously taken place, the procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation recommends that this public notice •    describe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.

If the municipality does not receive a sufficient number of referendum applications, the regulatory adoption process continues (e.g., establishment of compliance by the regional county municipality).

Any use or activity aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19 or similar measures (e.g., temporary hospitals, screening centres) are exempt from the process of amending urban planning by-laws.

However, under order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, any procedure involving the movement or gathering of citizens that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body is suspended or replaced.

However, with respect to the process of division into electoral districts, the council is not required to exercise this choice at the stage of the adoption of the draft by-law or at the stage of the adoption of the by-law. In fact, in the event that the required number of notices of objection is not reached, the process can continue in accordance with the requirements of the AERM, which should allow the deadline for the adoption of the by-law to be met, specifically before June 1, 2020.

However, if the required number of notices of objection is reached, either at the draft by-law stage (s. 18) or at the by-law stage (s. 25), the municipality must decide whether to postpone the process of territorial division into electoral districts (suspension) or to replace the meeting provided for in the AERM with a written consultation (replacement).
  Suspension - If the required number of notices of objection is reached at either the draft by-law stage (s. 18) or the by-law stage (s. 25), the council may decide to suspend the public meeting. In this case, the municipality should announce this by a public notice of postponement indicating that a new public notice announcing the holding of the meeting will be given after the end of the health emergency. In such circumstances, the process of division into electoral districts is suspended until further notice. Municipalities that decide to defer their by-law to divide into electoral districts should contact the ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation  to inform it of this decision .
  Replacement - If the required number of notices of objection is reached, either at the draft by-law stage (s. 18) or at the by-law stage (s. 25), the council may decide that the process of division into electoral districts should continue. In this case, it must designate this as a priority by a two-thirds majority vote. The consultation meeting is then replaced by a written consultation announced 15 days in advance by a public notice.
