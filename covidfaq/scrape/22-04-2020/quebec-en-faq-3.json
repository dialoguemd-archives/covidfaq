The interactive form costs nothing to use, and is simple and quick to complete. Simply enter your data, and the calculation will be carried out automatically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before adjusting the amount of child support payable, if you’ve lost your job, for instance, it would be best to know the amounts to which you will be entitled in order to determine your income.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The child support payment amount can also include costs related to children, for example daycare costs. Since parents will not have to cover these costs during the pandemic whether or not they are entitled to emergency daycare services, they may be taken into account when reviewing the support payable, but only for the period during which these fees are waived.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Educational childcare services will be free for parents who are essential service workers, which entitles them to emergency daycare services. Parents’ contributions will be covered by the Ministère de la Famille. Parents who can no longer use educational childcare services during the public health emergency will no longer have to pay childcare costs.
