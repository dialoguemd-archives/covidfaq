This particular condition is the subject of Order No. 2020-014 adopted on April\n  <span class=\"nbsp\">\n  </span>\n  2, 2020. Any municipality wishing to discuss the appropriateness of declaring a local state of emergency for a reason related to COVID-19 must first contact the direction de la santé publique in its territory. The latter will undertake a review of the situation in order to obtain authorization from the national public health director, if necessary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the event that a declaration of a state of local emergency is adopted in accordance with the conditions set out above, section\n  <span class=\"nbsp\">\n  </span>\n  47 of the Civil Protection Act provides that the municipality may exercise specific powers to protect the life, health, or integrity of persons. In exercising the specific powers granted to it by virtue of a state of local emergency, the municipality must, however, in accordance with order 2020-014, comply with any conditions that the national public health director may set, including any restriction on one or more of these powers. In addition, the measures provided for in the declaration of a local state of emergency may not exceed the authority stipulated in section\n  <span class=\"nbsp\">\n  </span>\n  47.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Any municipality that has declared a state of emergency under these conditions must send its declaration of a state of emergency to the direction régionale de la sécurité civile et de la sécurité incendie of the ministère de la Sécurité publique, accompanied by proof of authorization from the national public health director.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is essential to aim for the greatest possible congruence between measures to be taken by municipalities and those taken by the government. This will make it easier to achieve the benefits sought by all these measures, which are intended to ensure the best possible protection of public health.\n </p>\n</div>",
