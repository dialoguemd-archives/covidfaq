xPx Starting March 14, 2020, non-essential visits to hospitals, residential and long-term car centres, intermediate resources, targeted family-type resources and private senior’s residence will be prohibited to protect the most vulnerable individuals and workers in the health and social services network. xxPx

xPx Since March 23, 2020, a lockdown has been in place for anyone who lives in a residential and long-term care centre (CHSLD) or a private seniors’ residence (PSR), regardless of the person’s age. In intermediate resources and family-type resources (IR-FTR), this order applies to anyone who has a health condition that makes them vulnerable to COVID-19. xxPx

xPx The restriction is lifted temporarily for people who, for example, have to go out for health care or an essential health-related service or for humanitarian reasons. Outings are allowed but must be supervised. In addition, when people return to where they live, all infection prevention and control measures must be rigorously applied. xxPx
